        <p class="case-study-description">Delivery Agent App
        <p class="p1">The Task:  Identify the current problems and dictate the product direction for the Delivery Agent App.</p>
        <p class="p1">Objective: Optimise the existing design for the agents to efficiently view and pick jobs at a glance, deliver orders, and plan trips.</p>
        <p class="p1">Scope: 6 weeks</p>
        <p class="p1">Category: UX Research, UX Design, UI Design</p>
        <p class="p1">Role: Sole designer. Conducted user interviews, created wireframes and prototypes.</p>
        <p class="p1">Team: Product Manager, Software Engineers, Operations Team.</p>

          <p class="case-study-description">Pain Points
          <p class="p1">Agents were unable to differentiate between Same/ Next Day Deliveries, Pick up & Drop off time was unclear, 
            Dispatch concept was not purposeful, package dimensions were not regulated since it was displayed as S,M,L, agents 
            manually scroll and search for warehouse orders and lastly, the data showed low interaction with the Filter button.</p>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <p class="case-study-description">Exploration & Usability Testing</p>
          <img src="./images/DA04.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
          <p class="case-study-description">I used UserTesting.com to validate my designs and gain more insight.
            <p class="p1">When this iteration was tested, users claim that majority of the orders on the screen will either 
              show all Today or all Tomorrow hence the differentiation in colour coding days was unhelpful, the time blended 
              in with all the information and the Bundle Order and Exchange Order were not self explanatory to new users.</p>
        </figure>
        <p class="case-study-description">Design Solution</p>
          <img src="./images/DA05.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
          <p class="p1">I restructured information, primarily to communicate Location, Time, Job Earnings. And for secondary 
            but crucial information, those can be communicated through icons for faster understanding. Agents are looking at 
            the screen for long hours, hence further research was done in order to create a new Accessible Color Palette </p>

        <p class="case-study-description">What's Next</p>
        <p class="p1">I will validate all design decisions based on performance of key metrics such as active users, number of events and retention rates.</p>
        <p class="case-study-description">What I Learned</p>
        <p class="p1">The biggest lesson I learned at this startup is the tradeoff between quality and cost. Nothing is ever 'done' as 
          there's always room for improvement. However, designers have to learn to balance between time, cost and quality constraints.</p>
        <p class="p1">Redesigning the Pickupp Delivery Agent mobile app has been an incredible experience, and I'm really 
          grateful that I got to work on many platforms, and that Pickupp offered me projects with big impact that I would have ownership of.</p>
